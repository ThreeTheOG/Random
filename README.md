# Introduction

This is a repository for a lot of my old, or random projects/scripts.

## Installation

You must look at the imports at the top of each file to see what dependencies you need.

All of the dependencies are avaliable within PIP.
An example of an dependencie install is below.
```bash
pip install pyautogui
```

## Contributing

Please don't try to contribute, I won't accept them as I don't care very much about these old projects.
